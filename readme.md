# Github Commit Counter

Returns number of commits, +lines, and -lines for a given user across all repositories and all branches.

(kinda, seems like I'm still missing some commits but I don't know where.)

## Setup

Make sure to replace 'username' with your github username and 'your_github_token' with a github token that has repo access.

Create your token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens.

## Usage

`ruby commit_counter.rb`
